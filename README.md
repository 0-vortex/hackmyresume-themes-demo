## Overview

This is a demo repository for the hackmyresume npm package. It's supposed to output files in `dist/`

## Installation and usage

**1. Clone the repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/vrtxf/hackmyresume-themes-demo.git
```

**2. Edit `data/fresca.json`**

**3. Run the script**

```
npm run build
```

Disregard event emitter issues and if some folders are empty just re-run until everything works :D

## Deployment

If you're not satisfied with the fresh `positive` theme it's really easy to showcase a different `hackmyresume` generated resume just by editing `deploy.js`. 

Otherwise just run:

```
npm run deploy
```

You can view a demo over at [vrtxf.github.io](https://vrtxf.github.io/hackmyresume-themes-demo/).
